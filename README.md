# Welcome to my Github profile!

I'm currently a student at [Codam Coding College](https://www.codam.nl/en/), which is part of the [42 Network](https://www.42network.org/).
Besides my studies at Codam I'm currently learning Rust, and also dabble in game development from time to time.

I recently restarted solving Project Euler problems (I solved about 15 before resetting), my goal for 2023 is to solve at least 50 problems in C before the end of the year!
